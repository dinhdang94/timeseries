## Rains
```{r}
#consider only rain data, so we only need precipitation
pdx_rains <- pdx[pdx$X=="PR", ]

# pull out and clean up the amount of rain by month
rainfall_month <- pdx_rains$AVG.or.Total
rainfall_month <- gsub("M", NA, rainfall_month) #M is missing
rainfall_month <- gsub("T", 0, rainfall_month) #T is missing too, but they are close to 0 output, so I set T=0
rainfall_month <- as.numeric(rainfall_month)

# this is a time series we could work with
rain.ts <- ts(rainfall_month, start = c(1940,10),deltat = 1/12)

plot(rain.ts, main = "Portland, OR. Monthly Average Rainfall (1940-2019)",
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Precipitation (in)")

# there are two missing values
table(is.na(rain.ts))
# replace NA by its month average 
rainfall_month=rmna.avg(rain.ts, rainfall_month)
rain.ts <- ts(rainfall_month, start = c(1940,10), deltat = 1/12)
table(is.na(rain.ts))

```
## set up training data as the data before 2005
```{r}
rain.ts.train=ts(rainfall_month, start = c(1940,10), end=c(2004,12),deltat = 1/12)
```

## ARIMA Model analysis
```{r}
#difference the data
rain.ts.diff=diff(rain.ts.train, lag=12)
plot(rain.ts.diff)
rain.ts.diff=diff(rain.ts.diff, lag=12)
plot(rain.ts.diff)
```
```{r}
#ACF and PACF
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
acf(rain.ts.diff, lag.max=48, main='ACF')
pacf(rain.ts.diff,lag.max=120, main='PACF')
```

```{r}
# fit a SARIMA model
# 1 time difference
# seasonal lag 12 are zero out at ACF and PACF; so ARMA(1,1) model in seasonal. 
# non seasonal; ACF is cut off after lag1; but PACF is tail off. so it is MA(1)
# we will try ARIMA(0,1,1)x(1,1,1)12, ARIMA(1,1,1)x(0,1,1)12, ARIMA(0,1,2)x(0,1,1)12

(rain.fit1=arima(rain.ts.train, order=c(0,1,1), seasonal=list(order=c(1,1,1), period=12)))
(rain.fit2=arima(rain.ts.train, order=c(1,1,1), seasonal=list(order=c(0,1,1), period=12)))
(rain.fit3=arima(rain.ts.train, order=c(0,1,2), seasonal=list(order=c(0,1,1), period=12)))

```
## ARIMA(1,1,1)x(0,1,1)12 model provide min AIC: 3056.97

```{r}
#rain.fit1 fails at the ACF and PACF checking, so I suggest another model (with even lower AIC) at the bottom 
acf(rain.fit1$residuals)
pacf(rain.fit1$residuals)

#checking if residual is white noise
tsdiag(rain.fit2)
qqnorm(rain.fit2$residuals)
qqline(rain.fit2$residuals)
```



## predict and compare to the test data
```{r}
pred=predict(rain.fit2, n.ahead=181)
#plot the original data
plot(rain.ts, xlim=c(2005,2020), xlab='Rain Fall')
#adding the model prediction as red line; 95% confidence as blue line
lines(pred$pred, col='red')
lines(pred$pred-2*pred$se, col='blue')
lines(pred$pred+2*pred$se, col='blue')
```




Another model suggestion with lower AIC
```{r}
(rain.fit4=arima(rain.ts.train, order=c(1,0,0), seasonal=list(order=c(0,1,1), period=12)))
```


Model checking
```{r}
#AIC and PACF checking
acf(rain.fit4$residuals)
pacf(rain.fit4$residuals)

#checking if residual is white noise
tsdiag(rain.fit4)
qqnorm(rain.fit4$residuals)
qqline(rain.fit4$residuals)
```
