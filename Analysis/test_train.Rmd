```

For this file, run the 'Data cleaning.RMD' file first. 

This file is setup to create the training and test sets for model creation. 

```{r}
## extract time
t<- time(max_t_ts)
## create data frame of all variables
df<- data.frame(time = t, max_t = max_t_ts, min_t = min_t_ts, rain = rain.ts)

#length
L<-nrow(df)

## split df
tr<-1:(L-181)
train<- df[tr,]
test<- df[-tr,]

## save: may need to change the path to desired location
write.csv(train, "~/osu/ST566/project/timeseries/Data/train.csv", row.names = T)
write.csv(test, "~/osu/ST566/project/timeseries/Data/test.csv", row.names = T)
```
